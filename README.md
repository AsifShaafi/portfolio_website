# portfolio_website
This is a personal portfolio website of me.

## Intro
This website is for showcasing the information of Asif Imtiaz Shaafi. This website is made with just html and css files.
The css files are not written directly, they are created using _scss (Sassy CSS)_. For compiling the scss files, npm (node.js) has been used.

### compiling the css from scss
To make the css files from scss, first go to the root directory of the project, then open terminal in that location.
After that run 

        npm run scss

as scss is defined in the _package.json_ file. it will compile all scss files in the _./scss_ folder.
